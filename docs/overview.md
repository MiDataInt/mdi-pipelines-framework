This is the documentation for the **MDI pipelines framework**,
which provides support code for the development of 
MDI data analysis pipelines. It describes the functions and structures
defined by the framework that you can draw on to help you
create robust pipelines more quickly.

### Other important references

Information here will not repeat the 
descriptions of an MDI tools suite provided in the 
[documentation for the mdi-suite-template](/mdi-suite-template) - 
please read that first.
