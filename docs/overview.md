This is the documentation for the **MDI pipelines framework**,
which provides support code for the development of 
MDI data analysis pipelines. It describes the functions and structures
defined by the framework that you can draw on to
create robust pipelines more quickly.

### Other important references

Information here will not repeat the 
descriptions of an MDI tools suite provided in the 
[documentation for the mdi-suite-template](/mdi-suite-template) - 
please read that first.

You should also be familiar with the 
[mdi command line utility](https://github.com/MiDataInt/mdi)
and its
[documentation](/mdi).

The main purpose of these pages is to describe
the structure and utilities for a pipeline **Workflow.sh** script.

### Contributing to the framework

If you are experienced at something not yet represented in the 
framework - e.g., a workflow style or support
for a programming language - please consider adding standardized 
code for others to use as follows:

- fork the 
[mdi-pipelines-framework repository](https://github.com/MiDataInt/mdi-pipelines-framework)
- add/edit appropriate files
- make a pull request with a description of your additions
