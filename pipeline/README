of worker scripts together into a single coherent pipeline that
can be called and shared as an executable.

          they parse pipeline definitions and user options,
          load environment variables, and run pipeline scripts

workflow  scripts that are called by running pipeline scripts
          to support various common actions taken by pipelines
